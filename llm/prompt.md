You are tasked with extracting encryption key components from obfuscated JavaScript code. Please analyze the code and output the key components in JSON format.

Process these steps in order:

1. First, locate the key generation function. This is typically a short function that:
    - Returns a joined array of strings
    - Contains String.fromCharCode calls
    - Contains an atob() call
      Look for variable names like h(), w(), or similar short function names.

2. Within this function, identify:
    - The first sequence of String.fromCharCode() calls (these are usually added together with +)
    - A base64 encoded string (usually passed to atob())
    - A second sequence of String.fromCharCode() calls (usually in a single call with multiple parameters)

3. Extract these components and output them in this JSON format:
   {
   "part1": [integer array of character codes from first sequence],
   "part2": "base64 string",
   "part3": [integer array of character codes from second sequence]
   }

For each step, explain your reasoning and quote the relevant code snippets you're analyzing.

Example:
If you see code like:
const key = String.fromCharCode(65) + String.fromCharCode(66) + atob("YWJj") + String.fromCharCode(67,68,69)

You should output:
{
"part1": [65, 66],
"part2": "YWJj",
"part3": [67, 68, 69]
}

Ensure your output is **exclusively** valid JSON that matches the schema. Do not include any additional logic, codeblocks, nor words in your response. Only JSON.

If you are unable to discern a pattern, simply return the same JSON with all keys set to null.
